An archived snapshot of the official **Anthropic Claude Code CLI** source code. This metadata and source tree were exposed via an inadvertent `.map` file inclusion in the `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` npm package (v2.1.88) on March 31, 2026.

## 🔍 Overview
**Claude Code** is Anthropic's flagship terminal-based AI engineering agent. Unlike standard chat interfaces, it operates as a "Loop-in-the-Shell" agent capable of autonomous file manipulation, command execution, and multi-agent coordination.

### Technical Stack
* **Runtime:** Bun (utilizing `bun:bundle` and native performance features)
* **UI:** React + Ink (Terminal-based UI)
* **CLI Logic:** Commander.js
* **Validation:** Zod v4
* **Protocols:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) & LSP (Language Server Protocol)
* **Scale:** ~1,900+ files | ~500,000+ lines of code

## 🛠 Core Architecture

### 1. The Tooling System (`src/tools/`)
The agent utilizes over 40 specialized tools with strict schema validation and permission gates.
* **System Tools:** `BashTool`, `FileEditTool`, `GrepTool` (ripgrep integration).
* **Web/Data:** `WebSearchTool`, `WebFetchTool`, `JupyterTool`.
* **Advanced:** `AgentTool` (sub-agent spawning), `MCPTool`, `SkillTool`.

### 2. Command Interface (`src/commands/`)
The CLI supports a rich "Slash Command" ecosystem:
* **Dev Workflow:** `/commit`, `/review`, `/diff`, `/pr`.
* **Agent State:** `/memory`, `/context`, `/compact`, `/history`.
* **Advanced Utilities:** `/mcp`, `/vim`, `/voice`, `/tasks`.

### 3. The Query Engine (`src/QueryEngine.ts`)
The "brain" of the CLI (~46k lines). It manages:
* The core LLM streaming and tool-calling loops.
* Token budget tracking and context window management.
* Granular permission approval flows (Default, Plan, Auto, Bypass).
